#  Ranjita Hukkeri â€“ Cybersecurity Portfolio

I'm Ranjita, a certified cybersecurity analyst with hands-on experience in threat detection, SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel), incident response, and cloud security. This portfolio showcases practical projects that reflect my knowledge and skills across defensive security, scripting, and automation.Every project here is documented, working, and demonstrates specific technical skills Iâ€™m building toward SOC and cybersecurity engineering roles

##  Featured Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Splunk: SSH Brute Force Detection  
**What it does:** Simulates SSH brute-force attacks using logs from a Linux VM. Parses those logs in Splunk and builds custom SPL searches to detect suspicious login patterns.  
**Skills:** SPL, SIEM investigation, IOC analysis  
 [`splunk-ssh-brute-force`](./splunk-ssh-brute-force)

### ðŸ”¹ Microsoft Defender: Incident Simulation  
**What it does:** Uses Microsoft Defender XDR to investigate simulated malware alerts. Includes alert walkthroughs, endpoint context, and incident response steps.  
**Skills:** Alert triage, endpoint security, XDR  
 [`defender-xdr-incident`](./defender-xdr-incident)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Wazuh + Sysmon: Windows Process Monitoring  
**What it does:** Collects Sysmon logs from Windows and ingests them into Wazuh. Correlates suspicious parent-child processes and file events.  
**Skills:** Host-based monitoring, log analysis, open-source SIEM  
 [`wazuh-sysmon-monitoring`](./wazuh-sysmon-monitoring)

---

### ðŸ”¹ AWS S3 Static Website Hosting  
**What it does:** Walkthrough of deploying a static website on S3. Solves 403 access issues using ACLs and public policies.  
**Skills:** Cloud storage, access control, networking basics  
 [`aws-s3-static-site-hosting`](./AWS_Projects/AWS_S3_static_website_hosting)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Python: Phishing Email Analyzer  
**What it does:** Parses raw email headers and extracts indicators (IP, domain, SPF/DKIM results). Flags suspicious traits for triage.  
**Skills:** Python scripting, threat intel, email forensics  
 [`phishing_email_analyzer`](./phishing_email_analyzer)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Python: SIEM Log Parser  
**What it does:** Converts JSON-formatted log files into clean CSVs for SIEM ingestion. Supports field filtering and basic normalization.  
**Skills:** Log parsing, Python, data engineering for security  
 [`SIEM_log_parser`](./SIEM_log_parser)
