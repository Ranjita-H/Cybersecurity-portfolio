# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment Project

This project demonstrates how to conduct a vulnerability assessment using Tenable Nessus Essentials, export findings, and prepare them for reporting and remediation tracking.
This project parses Nessus vulnerability scan exports (CSV), extracts CVEs, and enriches them with descriptions from the NVD API. Outputs a structured Excel report with actionable details for further remediation.

##  Project Overview

- **Scanner:** Tenable Nessus Essentials
- **Scan Policy:** Basic Network Scan
- **Target:** Local lab environment
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Output:** CSV export of identified vulnerabilities

##  Workflow

1. **Scan Configuration**
   - Selected the Basic Network Scan policy.
   - Configured target assets in the lab environment.
   - Scheduled and launched the scan.

2. **Results Export**
   - Exported scan results as CSV for further parsing.
   - Captured screenshots for reference.

3. **Vulnerability Summary**
   - Node.js multiple vulnerabilities (22 findings).
   - SQLite memory corruption.
   - Ruby RACK DoS vulnerability.

4. **Planned Next Steps**
   - Automate parsing of CVE identifiers from the CSV.
   - Correlate each CVE with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
   - Enrich CVE data by querying NIST NVD API.
   - Generate markdown and Excel reports for stakeholders.

## Repository Contents

- `scan_data/` - Raw exported CSV file and screenshots.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for parsing and enrichment (in progress).
- `reports/` - Generated reports and documentation.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Develop CVE parsing script.
- [ ] Automate NVD API enrichment.
- [ ] Correlate MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
- [ ] Create markdown and Excel exports.
- [ ] Summarize remediation recommendations.
