# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment Project
This project helps transform raw Nessus vulnerability scan data into a clear, actionable Excel report that maps each CVE to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and prioritizes remediation based on risk.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Solves

Security teams often struggle to:
- Correlate CVEs to attacker TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures).
- Decide which vulnerabilities to fix first.
- Communicate risk to non-technical stakeholders.

This script automates:
âœ… Parsing Nessus scan CSV exports  
âœ… Mapping CVEs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
âœ… Determining exploitability and asset criticality  
âœ… Generating a prioritized Excel remediation report
