occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or

remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands on localhost.

It is, therefore, affected by
multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Wednesday February 14 2024 Security Releases advisory.

  - On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may have been set by an unprivileged user
    while the process is running with elevated privileges with the only exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due
    to a bug in the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when
    certain other capabilities have been set. This allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the
    process's elevated privileges. Impacts: Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and
    for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21892)

  - A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with
    chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an
    unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension
    bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like
    timeouts and body size limits. Impacts: Thank you, to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this vulnerability
    and thank you Paolo Insogna for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22019)

  - The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by calling path.resolve() on any paths
    given by the user. If the path is to be treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to
    obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer internals, namely,
    Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application can modify the result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path
    traversal vulnerability. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model
    is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and
    for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21896)

  - setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if initialized before the call to setuid().
    This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges
    through a call to setuid(). Impacts: Thank you, to valette for reporting this vulnerability and thank you
    Tobias Nieen for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22017)

  - A vulnerability in the privateDecrypt() API of the crypto library, allowed a covert timing side-channel
    during PKCS#1 v1.5 padding error handling. The vulnerability revealed significant timing differences in
    decryption for valid and invalid ciphertexts. This poses a serious threat as attackers could remotely
    exploit the vulnerability to decrypt captured RSA ciphertexts or forge signatures, especially in scenarios
    involving API endpoints processing Json Web Encryption messages. Impacts: Thank you, to hkario for
    reporting this vulnerability and thank you Michael Dawson for fixing it. (CVE-2023-46809)

  - Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths provided to node:fs functions,
    which can be overwitten with user-defined implementations leading to filesystem permission model bypass
    through path traversal attack. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission
    model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to xion for reporting this vulnerability and thank
    you Rafael Gonzaga for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21891)

  - The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation that wildcards should be only used as
    the last character of a file path. For example: --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub will ignore pub and
    give access to everything after .ssh/. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the
    permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this
    vulnerability and thank you Rafael Gonzaga for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21890)

  - On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may have been set by an unprivileged user
    while the process is running with elevated privileges with the only exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due
    to a bug in the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when
    certain other capabilities have been set. This allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the
    process's elevated privileges. Impacts: Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and
    for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21892)

  - A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with
    chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an
    unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension
    bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like
    timeouts and body size limits. Impacts: Thank you, to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this vulnerability
    and thank you Paolo Insogna for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22019)

  - The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by calling path.resolve() on any paths
    given by the user. If the path is to be treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to
    obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer internals, namely,
    Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application can modify the result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path
    traversal vulnerability. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model
    is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and
    for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21896)

  - setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if initialized before the call to setuid().
    This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges
    through a call to setuid(). Impacts: Thank you, to valette for reporting this vulnerability and thank you
    Tobias Nieen for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22017)

  - A vulnerability in the privateDecrypt() API of the crypto library, allowed a covert timing side-channel
    during PKCS#1 v1.5 padding error handling. The vulnerability revealed significant timing differences in
    decryption for valid and invalid ciphertexts. This poses a serious threat as attackers could remotely

  - The CVE-2024-27980 was identified as an incomplete fix for the BatBadBut vulnerability. This vulnerability
    arises from improper handling of batch files with all possible extensions on Windows via
    child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync. A malicious command line argument can inject arbitrary
    commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled. This vulnerability affects
    all users of child_process.spawn and child_process.spawnSync on Windows in all active release lines.
    Impact: Thank you, to tianst for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.
    (CVE-2024-27980)

  - A security flaw in Node.js allows a bypass of network import restrictions. By embedding non-network
    imports in data URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, compromising system security. Verified on
    various platforms, the vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding data URLs in network imports. Exploiting
    this flaw can violate network import security, posing a risk to developers and servers. Impact: Thank you,
    to dittyroma for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22020)

  - A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, affecting users of the experimental permission model when
    the --allow-fs-write flag is used. Node.js Permission Model do not operate on file descriptors, however,
    operations such as fs.fchown or fs.fchmod can use a read-only file descriptor to change the owner and
    permissions of a file. This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in
    Node.js 20 and Node.js 22. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an
    experimental feature of Node.js. Impact: Thank you, to 4xpl0r3r for reporting this vulnerability and thank
    you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2024-36137)

  - A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, affecting users of the experimental permission model when
    the --allow-fs-read flag is used. This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model that fails to
    restrict file stats through the fs.lstat API. As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats from files
    that they do not have explicit read access to. This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental
    permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 22. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the
    permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Impact: Thank you, to haxatron1 for reporting this
    vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22018)

  - The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix
    that can be ignored, which is not always true. This subtle bug leads to vulnerable edge cases. This
    vulnerability affects Windows users of the Node.js Permission Model in version v22.x and v20.x Impact:

  - A memory leak could occur when a remote peer abruptly closes the socket without sending a GOAWAY
    notification. Additionally, if an invalid header was detected by nghttp2, causing the connection to be
    terminated by the peer, the same leak was triggered. This flaw could lead to increased memory consumption

    and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it. (CVE-2025-23085)

  - With the aid of the diagnostics_channel utility, an event can be hooked into whenever a worker thread is
    created. This is not limited only to workers but also exposes internal workers, where an instance of them
    can be fetched, and its constructor can be grabbed and reinstated for malicious usage. This vulnerability

by multiple vulnerabilities:

  - In SQLite 3.44.0 through 3.49.0 before 3.49.1, the concat_ws() SQL function can cause memory to be written beyond 
    the end of a malloc-allocated buffer. If the separator argument is attacker-controlled and has a large string 
    (e.g., 2MB or more), an integer overflow occurs in calculating the size of the result buffer, and thus malloc may 
    not allocate enough memory. (CVE-2025-29087)

  - An integer overflow can be triggered in SQLite's `concat_ws()` function. The resulting, truncated integer is then 
    used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, 
    untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary 
    code execution. (CVE-2025-3277)
