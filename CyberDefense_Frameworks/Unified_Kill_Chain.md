Unified Kill Chain

Overview

The Unified Kill Chain is an advanced cybersecurity framework that extends the Cyber Kill Chain by incorporating adversary tactics from multiple frameworks, including MITRE ATT&CK. It provides a comprehensive view of cyberattacks, focusing on adversary movement and objectives within a network.

Key Stages of the Unified Kill Chain

The Unified Kill Chain is divided into three major phases:

1. Initial Foothold

This phase includes techniques used by adversaries to gain initial access to a target network.

Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target.

Initial Compromise: Exploiting vulnerabilities via phishing, malware, or social engineering.

Persistence Establishment: Deploying backdoors or malware for continuous access.

2. Network Propagation

After gaining access, attackers move laterally within the network and escalate privileges.

Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher-level permissions.

Credential Access: Extracting login credentials.

Lateral Movement: Expanding control over more systems within the network.

3. Action on Objectives

The attacker achieves their intended goal, which could include:

Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information.

Sabotage: Disrupting operations or causing damage.

Persistence: Maintaining access for future attacks.

Comparison with Cyber Kill Chain

Unlike the traditional Cyber Kill Chain, which is linear, the Unified Kill Chain acknowledges that attackers may revisit earlier steps or employ multiple attack paths simultaneously. This makes it more effective for modern, sophisticated attacks.

Applications in Cybersecurity

Advanced Threat Detection: Identifying attackers at various stages of intrusion.

Incident Response: Enhancing security team workflows for faster response.

Threat Intelligence: Understanding attacker behavior and methodologies.

Security Architecture Design: Improving defenses against lateral movement and privilege escalation.

Example Use Case

An attacker breaches an organization's network through phishing:

Initial Foothold: A malicious email attachment exploits a software vulnerability.

Network Propagation: The attacker escalates privileges and moves to critical systems.

Action on Objectives: Sensitive data is exfiltrated to an external server.

Conclusion

The Unified Kill Chain provides a more detailed and adaptable approach to understanding cyber threats compared to traditional frameworks. By analyzing attack progression across multiple stages, organizations can enhance their defense strategies and better protect their systems from sophisticated adversaries.

# Unified Kill Chain Framework

## Overview
The **Unified Kill Chain**, developed by Paul Pols in 2017, expands upon the Cyber Kill Chain by integrating **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques and addressing **modern attack methods** like lateral movement and persistence.

## Unified Kill Chain Phases
This framework consists of **three core phases** divided into **18 steps**:

### 1️⃣ **Initial Foothold**
| Stage | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **1. Reconnaissance** | Gathering information about the target (e.g., OSINT, network scanning). |
| **2. Resource Development** | Attackers prepare tools, infrastructure, and credentials. |
| **3. Initial Compromise** | Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access (e.g., phishing, exploit kits). |
| **4. Establish Foothold** | Deploying malware or backdoors for persistent access. |
| **5. Escalate Privileges** | Gaining higher-level access on the system. |

### 2️⃣ **Network Propagation**
| Stage | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **6. Defense Evasion** | Hiding malicious activity from security tools. |
| **7. Credential Access** | Stealing usernames, passwords, and authentication tokens. |
| **8. Discovery** | Identifying network assets and security measures. |
| **9. Lateral Movement** | Moving across the network to reach valuable targets. |
| **10. Maintain Presence** | Ensuring long-term access through persistence techniques. |

### 3️⃣ **Mission Completion**
| Stage | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **11. Collection** | Gathering sensitive data (e.g., financial records, credentials). |
| **12. Attack Objectives** | Executing malicious actions (e.g., data theft, ransomware). |
| **13. Impact** | Disrupting systems (e.g., wiping data, launching DDoS). |
| **14. Exfiltration** | Transmitting stolen data outside the network. |
| **15. Monetization** | Selling stolen data or demanding ransom. |
