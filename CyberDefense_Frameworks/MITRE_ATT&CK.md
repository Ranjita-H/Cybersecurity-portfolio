 Overview

The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework is a globally recognized cybersecurity knowledge base that categorizes tactics and techniques used by adversaries during cyberattacks. It helps security professionals detect, analyze, and defend against threats based on real-world attack behaviors.

Structure of MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK is divided into several key components:

1. Tactics

Tactics represent the high-level goals of an adversary during an attack. These include:

Initial Access – Gaining entry into a system.

Execution – Running malicious code.

Persistence – Maintaining access.

Privilege Escalation – Gaining higher system privileges.

Defense Evasion – Avoiding detection.

Credential Access – Stealing login credentials.

Discovery – Learning about the system and network.

Lateral Movement – Expanding access within the network.

Collection – Gathering data of interest.

Exfiltration – Stealing data from the system.

Impact – Disrupting or destroying systems.

2. Techniques

Techniques describe specific methods attackers use to achieve their objectives within each tactic. For example:

Phishing (Initial Access)

PowerShell Execution (Execution)

Registry Run Keys (Persistence)

Pass-the-Hash (Credential Access)

3. Procedures

Procedures describe real-world implementations of techniques used by specific threat actors.

4. Groups & Software

Adversary Groups: Cybercriminal groups and nation-state actors using specific techniques.

Software: Tools and malware used by adversaries.

Applications in Cybersecurity

Threat Intelligence: Understanding real-world attack methods.

Detection & Response: Mapping security logs to ATT&CK techniques.

Adversary Emulation: Simulating attacks to test defenses.

Threat Hunting: Proactively searching for attacker behaviors.

Example Use Case

An attacker attempts to breach a company's network:

Initial Access: A phishing email delivers malware.

Execution: Malware executes via PowerShell.

Privilege Escalation: Exploiting a vulnerability to gain admin rights.

Lateral Movement: Using stolen credentials to access critical systems.

Exfiltration: Sending stolen files to an external server.

Conclusion

The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a structured approach for understanding cyber threats based on real-world attack techniques. By aligning security operations with ATT&CK, organizations can enhance their threat detection, incident response, and overall cybersecurity posture.
