##  Understanding the Basics of Threat Intelligence & Its Classifications  

Threat Intelligence (TI) is the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying knowledge about cyber threats to enhance security defenses.  

###  Threat Intelligence Classifications  
1. **Strategic Threat Intelligence** – High-level insights for executives on attack motives & trends.  
2. **Tactical Threat Intelligence** – Focuses on attacker **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**.  
3. **Operational Threat Intelligence** – Real-time intelligence about **ongoing threats & incidents**.  
4. **Technical Threat Intelligence** – Specific indicators like **malicious IPs, hashes, domains**.

##  Using UrlScan.io to Scan for Malicious URLs  

### 🔹 What is UrlScan.io?  
[UrlScan.io](https://urlscan.io/) is an online service for **analyzing URLs and webpages** to detect malicious activity.  

###  Steps to Scan a URL  
1. Visit [UrlScan.io](https://urlscan.io/).  
2. Enter the **suspicious URL** in the search box.  
3. Click **"Public Scan"** (or **"Private Scan"** for confidential analysis).  
4. Analyze:  
   - **Screenshot** (checks for phishing).  
   - **Outbound requests** (identifies C2 servers).  
   - **Injected scripts** (detects malware payloads).  

###  Example Use Case  
A phishing email contains a **fake PayPal login link**. Scanning it with **UrlScan.io** reveals it’s **hosted on a suspicious server** and contains **keylogging scripts**.

##  Using Abuse.ch to Track Malware & Botnet Indicators  

### 🔹 What is Abuse.ch?  
[Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) provides **threat intelligence feeds** for tracking malware, botnets, and malicious URLs.  

###  Key Intelligence Feeds  
- **ThreatFox** – IOC database (IPs, domains, hashes).  
- **URLhaus** – Tracks **malware distribution URLs**.  
- **Feodo Tracker** – Monitors **botnet C2 servers**.  

###  Steps to Use Abuse.ch  
1. Visit [ThreatFox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/).  
2. Search for **file hashes, IPs, or domains**.  
3. **Analyze the results** for known threats.  

###  Example Use Case  
You find a **file attachment** in an email. Searching its **SHA256 hash** on **ThreatFox** shows it’s linked to the **Emotet banking trojan**.

##  Investigating Phishing Emails Using PhishTool  

###  What is PhishTool?  
[PhishTool](https://phishtool.com/) is an advanced phishing analysis platform that extracts email metadata, validates SPF/DKIM, and detects malicious links.  

###  Steps to Investigate a Phishing Email  
1. Open **PhishTool** and upload the **phishing email**.  
2. **Analyze metadata**, including:  
   - Sender domain & SPF/DKIM records.  
   - Malicious links & redirections.  
   - Attachment hashes (checks for malware).  
3. Cross-check with **Abuse.ch** or **Cisco Talos**.  

###  Example Use Case  
A "PayPal security alert" email asks for login details. **PhishTool reveals domain spoofing and hidden tracking pixels**, confirming it's phishing.

##  Using Cisco Talos Intelligence for Threat Intel Gathering  

###  What is Cisco Talos?  
[Cisco Talos](https://talosintelligence.com/) is a **threat intelligence platform** providing data on malware, DNS reputation, and attack campaigns.  

###  Steps to Use Cisco Talos  
1. Go to [Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com/).  
2. Enter an **IP, domain, or file hash** in the search bar.  
3. **Review the reputation score**:  
   -  **Good** – Likely safe.  
   -  **Neutral** – Needs investigation.  
   -  **Malicious** – Associated with cyber threats.  
4. Analyze **historical activity, geolocation, and attack sources**.  

###  Example Use Case  
A **server logs repeated login attempts** from an unknown IP. **Cisco Talos identifies it as a botnet IP**, allowing proactive blocking.
